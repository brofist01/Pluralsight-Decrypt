### Who/Why I Build It ?

when I was in college. We had limited WiFi data allowance, it was slow and worked only till 12:30AM. Keeping these things in mind I build this extension.

I no more use this app and there is no further development from my side. Although, anyone willing to do any further development is free to open issues and make PRs. Least I can do is review and merge them.
